# GraySim: Page Replacement

This repository contains a simulation that is intended to help students understand page replacement algorithms used by operating systems.

## The Algorithms
- **First-In First-Out (FIFO)**: Replace the page that was brought into memory first
- **Least Recently Used (LRU)**: Replace the page that has not been used for the longest time period
- **Optimal (OPT)**: Replace the page that will be used furthest into the future
- **Clock (CLOCK)**: Replace the page identified by the clock algorithm
